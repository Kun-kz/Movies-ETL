# Movie-ETL
## Overview
In the project, we created 4 scripts that took in data, performed the appropriate transformations, and loaded the data into existing tables in a SQL database.  
The following tasks were completed:
1.	Write an ETL function to read three data files.
2.	Extract and transform the Wikipedia data.
3.	Extract and transform the Kaggle data.
4.	Create the SQL movie database.
## Resources
-	Data Source: wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv (in the Resources folder)
-	Software: Python 3.7.6, PostgreSQL 11
## Results
1. ETL_function_test.ipynb was created to read three data files.
2. ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb could extract and transform the Wikipedia data.
3. ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb could extract and transform the Kaggle data.
4. ETL_create_database.ipynb was created to create the SQL Movie database.
